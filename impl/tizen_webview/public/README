Tizen WebView Public API
========================

This directory contains the public API for using Tizen WebView.
The primary consumer of this API is chromium-ewk package,
which is for providing Tizen's historic EWK API.

The ground rule is as follows:
- The public headers in this directory should not depend on 
  other chromium headers outside this directory
- Clients of chromium-efl (e.g, chromium-ewk package) should 
  rely only on the public headers
- The api and types defined in the public headers should be
  under the namespace tizen_webview

The convention:
- use prefix 'tw_' for file name
